In this phase of our project, we turn our attention to the critical aspect of navigation within the Dynamic Calling Card (DCC). Building on the visual and interactive components developed in earlier assignments, Homework 4 challenges us to design a navigation system that is both intuitive and engaging. Utilizing Figma, we aim to create a prototype that demonstrates how users will move between different panels of the DCC, ensuring a smooth and coherent experience. This report documents the design process, the decisions made, and the rationale behind the chosen navigation strategy, setting the stage for its future implementation in P5JS.

# Journey of a young man

# Introduction

# User Testing

I shared it with my close friend. I asked him how it looks like and is it user-friendly. He said it is user-friendly and he was able to understand most of themes of the young man's journey. Though, I could improve on making it look better and be more creative.


# Reflection

I really enjoyed working on this assignment. The most satisfying this is definitely testing out the app by navigating through the panels by clicking icons. The most difficult would be trying to understand how figma works like how to connect between frames and bringing in icons. If I had more time I would spent time time making it look better and be creative like my friend suggested.
